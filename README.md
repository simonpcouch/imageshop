=========

##### *Simon P. Couch*

This repository contains the source code for a basic photo editor, ImageShop, implemented in Python for Computer Science 121 at Reed College (Fall 2018). The modules `pgl.py`, `filechooser.py`, and part of `GrayScaleImage.py` were written by Eric Roberts. The application can be initialized from the command line by the command `python3 ImageShop.py`.
